# HR + Zone Data Field

This is a Garmin Connect IQ data field that displays your current heart rate and the corresponding heart rate zone during an activity.

## Features

- Displays your current heart rate in a large, easy-to-read font.
- Shows the current heart rate zone (e.g., Z1, Z2) just below the heart rate.
- Uses the user's specific heart rate zones from their Garmin profile for accurate zone calculations.
- Updates in real-time during an activity.

## How it works

The data field fetches your current heart rate and compares it to the heart rate zones defined in your Garmin user profile for the current sport. It then displays both your heart rate and the calculated zone.
